        Story [Exec Broker] Update the service API
        https://jira.skatelescope.org/browse/COR-642
            Do we need the separate worker interface ?
            Do we use conventional POST methods for every property, or do we use 'options' to POST changes ?

        Decision -
            No need for the separate worker interface.
            Using options to handle object updates.

            Start with the interface design.
            Manually edit the OpenAPI spec.
            Generate framework code from the spec.
            Add the business login in a separate project.

# -----------------------------------------------------
# Create a new OpenAPI specification.
