        Notes on the CIRASA-planner project.

    Result:

        Work in progress ...

# -----------------------------------------------------

    Core aim is to use the CIRASA visualization tools as a use-case for the ExecutionPlanner service.
    Develop a simple "can I do this" implementation of the ExecutionPlanner API that can run the CIRASA visualization tools.

    Initial step is to create a poster describing the work.
    Needs some nice diagrams to fill out the poster.

    Step #1
    Setup a GitHub project to work on it together ..

        IVOA/CIRASA-planner
