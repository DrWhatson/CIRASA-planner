    OptaPlanner optimizes plans and schedules with hard constraints and soft constraints.

    OptaPlanner is a lightweight, embeddable planning engine.
    It enables everyday programmers to solve optimization problems efficiently.
    Constraints apply on plain domain objects and can call existing code.
    It is Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP) friendly.
    Thereâ€™s no need to input constraints as mathematical equations.
