    CIRASA
    Collaborative and Integrated platform for Radio Astronomical Source Analysis

    Visual analytic platform (CIRASA)
    CAESAR source finder
    ViaLactea Visual Analytic (VLVA)
    ViaLactea Knowledge Base (VLKB)


    Some of the provided features
    (e.g. source extraction and analysis algorithms)
    are, however, general purpose and may well serve the broader astronomical community
    in other wavelength domains (e.g. infrared, optical or gamma).
